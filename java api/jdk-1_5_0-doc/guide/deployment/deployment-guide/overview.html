<h2><a name="installation"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>There are two types of deployment technologies available in Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
2 Standard Edition (J2SE)&nbsp; for deploying client-side Java applications on 
the desktop:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Java Plug-in<br>
  <br>
  Java Plug-in is a tool used for deploying Java applets that run inside a web 
  browser.&nbsp;Supported web browsers include Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Netscape Navigator. For more 
  information, see <a href="../../plugin/developer_guide/contents.html">Java 
  Plug-in Developer Guide</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Java Web Start <br>
  <br>
  Java Web Start is a tool used for deploying standalone Java applications on the desktop, 
  using JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol). For more 
  information, see <a href="../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java 
  Web Start Developer Guide</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In J2SE 5.0, many similar deployment features between Java Plug-in and Java 
Web Start have been consolidated. The focus of this guide is to outline common 
deployment features and general deployment practices for both products.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation of the Java Platform</h2>
<p>To deploy a Java applet or application, one must first decide how to deploy 
the JRE (Java 2 Runtime Environment) . The JRE is available in many
<a href="../../../../download-info.html">install formats</a> for download and 
manual install. An <a href="autodownload.html">automatic download</a> and 
install is available for deploying JRE and applications  through 
the browsers on Windows. Enterprise developers or ISVs who would like the JRE to install 
silently, can use the <a href="silent.html">silent installation</a> option 
in the installer. For developers and ISVs deploying the Java Platform in  
Windows-only environments, they should also check out the
<a href="install-msi.html">Active Directory deployment</a> option in the installer. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="writing"></a>Writing Java applets and applications</h2>
<p>Applets and applications written in the Java Programming language are the 
main target for deployment. Java(TM) 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v 5.0 
  API Specification provides the means, along with various compilers and debuggers, 
  to develop applets and applications in the Java Programming language. See 
<a href="../../../api/index.html">Java(TM) 
  2 Platform, Standard Edition, v 5.0 API Specification</a>.</p>
<p>If you are migrating applets from Microsoft VM to Sun's Java Virtual Machine, 
please check out <a href="applet-compatibility.html">Applet Compatibility</a>,
<a href="upgrade-guide/index.html">Java Upgrade Guide</a> and
<a href="repository.html">System-Wide Repository</a> for tips on the migration.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="authoring"></a>Deploying Java applets and applications</h2>
<p>To deploy applets and applications over the Internet, it is necessary to 
specify the applets and applications on the web page for download and launch.</p>
<p>For an applet in a web page displayed in a browser using Sun's JVM, the applet 
  must be embedded in the page with the required tagging structure for Java Plug-in. 
  For topics related to Java Plug-in, see the <a href="../../plugin/developer_guide/contents.html">Java 
  Plug-in Developer Guide</a>. </p>
<p> To seamlessly download, cache, and launch an applications from a web page, 
  such a page will need to contain a link to a special Java Network Launch Protocol 
  (JNLP) file on a web server. Java Web Start, which comes with the JRE, 
  will then be able to download, cache, and launch the application. For topics 
  related to JNLP and Java Web Start, see the
<a href="../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java 
  Web Start Developer Guide</a>.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="setting"></a>Networking in Java Deployment</h2>
<p>Both Java Plug-in and Java Web Start support the deployment of applets and applications  over many 
types of network protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOCKS) and many types of 
security 
authentication  (HTTP Basic, Digest, NTLM).&nbsp; </p>
<p>For deployment of the applets and applications  behind a proxy server, Java Plug-in and 
Java Web Start also provide complete proxy support for various 
configurations from the browser as well as from the Java Control Panel. See
<a href="proxie_config.html">Proxy Configuration</a>.</p>
<p>For applets and applications deployed from servers or connecting to servers, 
Java Plug-in and Java Web Start also provide complete cookie support as a way 
for servers to store data on the client side. See <a href="cookie_support.html">Cookie</a>.</p>
<p>Although Java Archive (JAR) is the de facto way to package applets and 
applications, 
 
it is not always the most efficient for network download. Two new compression formats 
are available for deploying Java applets and applications in Java Plug-in and Java 
Web Start: gzip and Pack200. 
  See <a href="pack200.html">Pack200 and Compression</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="setting"></a>Security in Java Deployment</h2>
<p>By default, Java applets and applications deployed using Java Plug-in and 
Java Web Start 
are run in a secure sandbox which defines the set of permissions 
granted to an untrusted application. See <a href="security.html">Security</a>.</p>
<p>
With JAR  signing, Java applets and applications deployed using Java 
Plug-in and Java Web Start are allowed to run outside the sandbox with 
additional permissions, if the users grant the permissions to the trusted 
application. See
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/jarsigner.html">
jarsigner</a> on how to properly sign an application for deployment.</p>
<p>
To ensure the signed applets and applications will continue to work after 
deployment even if the certificate has expired, deployers should consider 
signature timestamp signing. This is fully supported by 
Java Plug-in and Java Web Start. See
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/time-of-signing-beta1.html">
Signature Timestamp</a>.</p>
<p>During  signature verification and HTTPS server/client authentication, certificates and keys in the default Java keystore are 
used by Java Plug-in and Java Web Start. In addition, Java Plug-in and Java Web 
Start also support certificates and keys in the browser and on the smart card 
for various purposes. See <a href="keystores.html">Browser Keystores</a>.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="setting"></a>Configuration in Java Deployment</h2>
<p>Under the cover of Java Plug-in and Java Web Start, many aspects of the 
deployment environment, including security access controls, networking 
configuration, certificate stores, etc., are configurable through deployment 
configuration properties. </p>
<p>For developers who would like to customize the deployment environment, 
the deployment configuration file can be used for customization. </p>
<p>For enterprise developers or ISVs who would like to centrally deploy a 
configuration to tens of thousands of systems, they can also leverage the 
enterprise configuration support that is built-into the deployment configuration 
infrastructure in Java Plug-in and Java Web Start. See <a href="properties.html">
Deployment Configuration File and Properties</a> for more details. </p>
<p>For developers or end users who would like to customize a user specific 
deployment environment in a user-friendly manner, Java Control Panel is a tool 
that can be used to serve this purpose. See <a href="jcp.html">Java Control Panel</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
<a name="setting"></a>Debugging in Java Deployment</h2>
<p> Debugging Java applets and applications is often done through Java IDEs or Java 
debuggers. In addition, Java Plug-in and Java Web Start have several 
built-in facilities that make debugging easier, including <a href="console.html">Java Console</a>, and
<a href="tracing_logging.html">Tracing and Logging</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
<a name="setting"></a>Updating the Java Platform</h2>
<p>Java Update is a solution for keeping the Java platform up-to-date 
automatically with latest updates on end users' supported Windows platform. Java Update is bundled with the JRE, 
so every system with a JRE installed is also Java Update enabled by 
default. Java Update keeps most systems up-to-date with latest versions of the 
JRE.&nbsp; Therefore, developers are encouraged to take advantage of the latest JRE 
features for development, without worrying too much on deploying the latest JRE 
on their customers systems. For more information, see <a href="java-update.html">Java Update</a>.<br>
