<H2>What is the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)?</H2>

JPDA is a multi-tiered debugging architecture that allows
tools developers to easily create debugger applications
which run portably across platforms, 
<A HREF="#vm">virtual machine (VM)</A> implementations
and JDK versions.
<P>
JPDA consists of three layers:
<DL>
  <DT> <A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A> - Java VM Tool Interface
  <DD> JVMTI is a new interface in J2SE 5.0 which replaces JVMDI. It defines the debugging services a VM provides.

  <DT> <A HREF="#jdwp">JDWP</A> - Java Debug Wire Protocol
  <DD>      Defines the communication between <A HREF="#debuggee">debuggee</A>
            and debugger processes.

  <DT> <A HREF="#jdi">JDI</A> - Java Debug Interface
  <DD>      Defines a high-level Java language interface
        which tool developers can easily use to
        write remote debugger applications.
</DL>

<H2>Reference implementation</H2>

In addition to the specification of these interfaces,
Sun Microsystems also
provides a reference implementation, which consists of:
<UL>
<LI>JVMTI implementations on multiple Sun VMs 
(see <a href="../vm/index.html">VM documentation</a>).

<LI>A <A HREF="#back-end">back-end</A> which uses JVMTI to implement the debuggee
side of JDWP.

<LI>A <A HREF="#front-end">front-end</A> which uses the debugger side of JDWP to
implement JDI.

<LI>Two simple example debugger applications which are built on JDI.
</UL>
This provides a layered implementation in which any layer 
may be substituted.

<H2>Using JPDA</H2>

A debugger developer may hook into JPDA at any layer.  Since
the JDI is the highest level and easiest to use we encourage
developers to use this interface.   Suppose a company
develops a debugger using JDI.  They can use it with the
reference implementation and it will automatically work with
the VMs and platforms Sun supports.  It
can also work, for example, with the reference implementation
front-end and a debuggee running another
company's VM that implements JDWP (which might use or by-pass JVMTI).  
<P>
Some debuggers are built on top of lower
layers, JDWP (for example if the front-end is not written in the
Java language) or JVMTI (for specialized debuggers which need low-level
functionality).

Components</H1></CENTER>

<A NAME="debuggee"></A>
<H2>
debuggee</H2>

<UL>The debuggee is the process being debugged, it consists of the application
being debugged (not shown), the <A HREF="#vm">VM</A> running the application
and the <A HREF="#back-end">back-end</A> of the debugger.</UL>

<A NAME="vm"></A>
<H2>
Java Virtual Machine (VM)</H2>

<UL>This refers to the VM running the application being debugged.

<P>The debugger architecture is being designed for use in wide spectrum
of VM implementations.

<P>The VM implements the Java Virtual Machine Debug Interface (<A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A>).</UL>

<A NAME="back-end"></A>
<H2>
back-end</H2>

<UL>The back-end of the debugger is responsible for communicating requests
from the debugger <A HREF="#front-end">front-end</A> to the debuggee <A HREF="#vm">VM</A>
and for communicating the response to these requests (including desired
events) to the front-end.&nbsp; The back-end communicates with the front-end
over a <A HREF="#channel">communications channel</A> using the Java Debug
Wire Protocol (<A HREF="#jdwp">JDWP</A>).&nbsp; The back-end communicates
with the debuggee VM using the Java Virtual Machine Debug Interface (<A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A>).

<P>It is clear from experience that debugger support code, running on the
debuggee and written in Java, contends with the debuggee in ways that cause
hangs and other undesired behavior. Thus, the back-end is native code.
This, in turn, implies that the <A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A>
be a pure native interface.</UL>

<A NAME="channel"></A>
<H2>
communications channel</H2>

<blockquote>
<p>The communications channel is the link between the <a href="#front-end">front</a> and <a href="#back-end">back</a>
ends of the debugger. It can be thought of as consisting of two mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
<li> A connector. A connector is a JDI object that is the means by which a connection is established between the
	front and back-ends. </p>

<p>JPDA defines three types of connectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>listening connectors: The front-end listens for an incoming connection from the back-end
	</li><li>attaching connectors: The front-end attaches to an already running back-end.
	</li><li>launching connectors: The front-end actually launches the java process that will run the debuggee code and the
	back-end.
	</li></ul>
<p>
<li> A transport. A transport is the underlying mechanism used to move bits between the front-end and the back-end.<br>
<br>
The transport mechanism used is unspecified; possible mechanisms include: sockets, serial lines, and shared memory.
	However, the format and semantics of the serialized bit-stream flowing over the channel is specified by the Java
	Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP).<br>
</ol>
Starting with J2SE 5.0, JPDA includes service provider interfaces to allow the development and
	deployment of connector and transport implementations. These service provider
	interfaces allow debugger and other tool vendors to develop new connector
	implementations and provide addition transport mechanisms over and beyond the
	socket and shared memory transport provided by Sun. The service provider interfaces 
	in JDI are specified in the 
	<a href="jdi/com/sun/jdi/connect/spi/package-summary.html">
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi</a> package. </p>
<p>In addition to the service provider interfaces in JDI, JPDA also
	defines a transport library interface called the <a href="jdwpTransport.html">Java 
	<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>Debug Wire Protocol Transport Interface</a>. A transport 
	library is loaded by the JDWP agent in the target VM and is used to establish a 
	connection to the debugger and to transport JDWP packets between the debugger and the 
	VM. </p>
See <a href="jpda_spis.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Platform Debugger 
	Architecture - Service Provider Interfaces</a> for more
	information on using these SPIs.

<A NAME="front-end"></A>
<H2>
front-end</H2>

<UL>The debugger front-end implements the high-level Java Debug Interface
(<A HREF="#jdi">JDI</A>).&nbsp; The front-end uses the information from
the low-level Java Debug Wire Protocol (<A HREF="#jdwp">JDWP</A>).
</UL>

<A NAME="ui"></A>
<H2>
User Interface (UI)</H2>

<UL>The user interface to the debugger is not specified; the intent is
that tool vendors will provide value added implementations. We
provide an example simple graphical user interface (GUI) which serves
as test harness and as a starting point for the development of more 
complex GUIs. A version of JDB is also available as an example. 

<P>The example UIs are clients of the Java Debug 
Interface (<A HREF="#jdi">JDI</A>).</UL>

<CENTER>
<H1>

<HR><A NAME="interfaces"></A>Debugger Interfaces</H1></CENTER>

<A NAME="jvmti">
<H2>
Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVMTI)</H2></A>

<UL>A native interface implemented by the <A HREF="#vm">VM</A>.

<P>Defines the services a VM must provide for debugging. Includes requests
for information (for example, current stack frame), actions (for example,
set a breakpoint), and notification (for example, when a breakpoint has
been hit). A debugger may make use of VM information other than this (for
example, Java Native Interface (JNI)), but this is the source of all debugger specific information.

<P>Specifying the VM Interface allows
any VM implementor to plug easily into the debugging architecture. It also
allows alternate communication channel implementations. VM implementations
which do not adhere to this interface can still provide access via the
Java Debug Wire Protocol (<A HREF="#jdwp">JDWP</A>).

<P>See also:
<UL><A HREF="../jvmti/jvmti.html">
JVMTI Specification</A></UL>
&nbsp;</UL>

<A NAME="jdwp">
<H2>
Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP)</H2></A>

<UL>Defines the format of information and requests transferred between
the <A HREF="#debuggee">debuggee</A> process and the debugger <A HREF="#front-end">front-end</A>.&nbsp;
It does not define the transport mechanism (socket, serial line, shared
memory, ...).

<P>The specification of the protocol allows the debuggee and debugger front-end
to run under separate VM implementations and/or on separate platforms.
It also allows the front-end to be written in a language other than Java,
or the debuggee to be non-native (e.g. Java).

<P>Information and requests are roughly at the level of the Java Virtual
Machine Debug Interface (<A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A>), but will include
additional information and requests necessitated by bandwidth issues, examples
include information filtering and batching.

<P>See also:
<UL><A HREF="jdwp-spec.html">JDWP Specification</A></UL>

<UL>
<a href="jdwpTransport.html">JDWP Transport Specification</a>
</UL>
&nbsp;</UL>

<A NAME="jdi">
<H2>Java Debug Interface (JDI)</H2></A>

<UL>A 100% Java interface implemented by the <A HREF="#front-end">front-end</A>.

<P>Defines information and requests at a user code level. 

<P>While debugger implementors could&nbsp; directly use the Java Debug
Wire Protocol (<A HREF="#jdwp">JDWP</A>) or Java Virtual Machine Debug
Interface (<A HREF="#jvmti">JVMTI</A>), this interface greatly facilitates
the integration of debugging capabilities into development environments.
We recommend the JDI layer for all debugger development.
