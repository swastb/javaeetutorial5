<H2><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P>The global Internet demands global software - that is, software
that can be developed independently of the countries or languages of
its users, and then localized for multiple countries or regions. The
Java Platform provides a rich set of APIs for developing global
applications. These internationalization APIs are based on the
Unicode standard and include the ability to adapt text, numbers,
dates, currency, and user-defined objects to any country's
conventions.</P>

<P>This document summarizes the internationalization APIs and
features of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. For coding
examples and step-by-step instructions, see the
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/index.html">Java
Tutorial</A>. The detailed APIs are found in the
<A HREF="../../../api/index.html">Java Platform, Standard Edition, API
Specification</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="textrep"></A>Text Representation</H2>

<P>The Java programming language is based on the
<A HREF="http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html">Unicode</A>
character set, and several libraries implement the Unicode standard.
Unicode is an international character set standard which supports all
of the major scripts of the world, as well as common technical
symbols. The original Unicode specification defined characters as
fixed-width 16-bit entities, but the Unicode standard has since been
changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
than 16 bits. The range of legal code points is now U+0000 to
U+10FFFF. An encoding defined by the standard, UTF-16, allows to
represent all Unicode code points using one or two 16-bit units.</P>

<P>The primitive data type char in the Java programming language is
an unsigned 16-bit integer that can represent a Unicode code point in
the range U+0000 to U+FFFF, or the code units of UTF-16. The various
types and classes in the Java platform that represent character
sequences - char[], implementations of java.lang.CharSequence (such
as the String class), and implementations of
java.text.CharacterIterator - are UTF-16 sequences. Most Java source
code is written in ASCII, a 7-bit character encoding, or ISO-8859-1,
an 8-bit character encoding, but is translated into UTF-16 before
processing.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../../../api/java/lang/Character.html">Character</A>
class as an object wrapper for the char primitive type. The Character
class also contains static methods such as isLowerCase() and
isDigit() for determining the properties of a character. Since J2SE
5, these methods have overloads that accept either a char (which
allows representation of Unicode code points in the range U+0000 to
U+FFFF) or an int (which allows representation of all Unicode code
points).</P>

<H2><A NAME="locale"></A>Locale Identification and Localization</H2>

<H3>Locales</H3>

<P>On the Java platform, a locale is simply an identifier for a
particular combination of language and region. It is not a collection
of locale-specific attributes. Instead, each locale-sensitive class
maintains its own locale-specific information. With this design,
there is no difference in how user and system objects maintain their
locale-specific resources. Both use the standard localization
mechanism.</P>

<P>Java programs are <EM>not</EM> assigned a single global locale.
All locale-sensitive operations may be explicitly given a locale as
an argument. This greatly simplifies multilingual programs. While a
global locale is not enforced, a default locale is available for
programs that do not wish to manage locales explicitly. A default
locale also makes it possible to affect the behavior of the entire
presentation with a single choice.</P>

<P>Java locales act as requests for certain behavior from another
object. For example, a French Canadian locale passed to a Calendar
object asks that the Calendar behave correctly for the customs of
Quebec. It is up to the object accepting the locale to do the right
thing. If the object has not been localized for a particular locale,
it will try to find a "close" match with a locale for which it has
been localized. Thus if a Calendar object was not localized for
French Canada, but was localized for the French language in general,
it would use the French localization instead.</P>

<H4>Locale Class</H4>

<P>A <A HREF="../../../api/java/util/Locale.html">Locale</A> object
represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region. An
operation that requires a locale to perform its task is called
locale-sensitive and uses the Locale object to tailor information for
the user. For example, displaying a number is a locale-sensitive
operation - the number should be formatted according to the customs
and conventions of the user's native country, region, or culture.
</P>

<H4>Supported Locales</H4>

<P>On the Java platform, there does not have to be a single set of
supported locales, since each class maintains its own localizations.
Nevertheless, there is a consistent set of localizations supported by
the classes of the Java Platform. Other implementations of the Java
platform may support different locales. Those supported by Sun's Java
SE Runtime Environments are summarized in the web page
<A HREF="locale.doc.html">Supported Locales</A>.</P>

<H3>Localized Resources</H3>

<P>All locale-sensitive classes must be able to access resources
customized for the locales they support. To aid in the process of
localization, it helps to have these resources grouped together by
locale and separated from the locale-neutral parts of the program.
</P>

<H4>ResourceBundle Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">ResourceBundle</A>
is an abstract base class representing containers of resources.
Programmers create subclasses of ResourceBundle that contain
resources for a particular locale. New resources can be added to an
instance of ResourceBundle, or new instances of ResourceBundle can be
added to a system without affecting the code that uses them.
Packaging resources as classes allows developers to take advantage of
Java's class loading mechanism to find resources.</P>

<P>Resource bundles contain locale-specific objects. When a program
needs a locale-specific resource, a String object for example, the
program can load it from the resource bundle that is appropriate for
the current user's locale. In this way, the programmer can write code
that is largely independent of the user's locale isolating most, if
not all, of the locale-specific information in resource bundles.</P>

<P>This allows Java programmers to write code that can:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>be easily localized, or translated, into different languages
   
   <LI>handle multiple locales at once
   
   <LI>be easily modified later to support even more locales
</UL>

<H5>ResourceBundle.Control Class</H5>

<P><A HREF="../../../api/java/util/ResourceBundle.Control.html">
ResourceBundle.Control</A> is a nested class of ResourceBundle. It
defines methods to be called by the 
<A HREF="../../../api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#getBundle(java.lang.String,%20java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.ClassLoader,%20java.util.ResourceBundle.Control)">
ResourceBundle.getBundle</A> factory methods so that the resource
bundle loading behavior may be changed. For example, application
specific resource bundle formats, such as XML, could be supported
by overriding the methods.</P>

<H4>ListResourceBundle Class</H4>

<P><A HREF="../../../api/java/util/ListResourceBundle.html">ListResourceBundle</A>
is an abstract subclass of ResourceBundle that manages resources for
a locale in a convenient and easy to use list.</P>

<H4>PropertyResourceBundle Class</H4>

<P><A HREF="../../../api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html">PropertyResourceBundle</A>
is a concrete subclass of ResourceBundle that manages resources for a
locale using a set of static strings from a property file.</P>

<P>
<HR>
<p></P>

<H2><A NAME="time"></A>Date and Time Handling</H2>

<P>The java.util.Date class represents a specific instant in time
with millisecond precision, independent of time zones and locales.
</P>

<P>The Date class contains several methods for the interpretation of
dates as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, and for
formatting and parsing date strings. These methods are incompatible
with internationalization, and most of them therefore are deprecated.
Instead of them, applications should use the Calendar class to
convert between date and time fields, and the DateFormat class to
format and parse date strings.</P>

<H4>Calendar Class</H4>

<P>The class <A HREF="../../../api/java/util/Calendar.html">Calendar</A>
is an abstract base class which can convert between a point in time
(represented as milliseconds from 00:00:00 GMT, Jan 1, 1970) and a
set of integers representing the year, month, week and so on.
GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of Calendar that does this
according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.</P>

<P>Calendar and its subclasses are useful for doing various
manipulations with time values. Arithmetic can be performed on a
Calendar object's fields and the resulting date determined. A
Calendar object can produce all the time field values needed to
implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and
calendar style. Refer to the web page <A HREF="calendar.doc.html">Supported
Calendars</A> for details.</P>

<H4>TimeZone Class</H4>

<P>The abstract class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/util/TimeZone.html">TimeZone</A> encapsulates
a time zone offset from GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) and a
possible daylight saving time offset. The <A
HREF="../../../api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getTimeZone(java.lang.String)">
TimeZone.getTimeZone</A> factory method can be called to get a
TimeZone instance for a time zone ID. The <A
HREF="../../../api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDefault()">
TimeZone.getDefault</A> factory method automatically detects the
platform time zone and returns a TimeZone instance that matches the
platform time zone.</P>

<P>The Calendar class and its subclasses use the TimeZone 
class to convert between local time and UTC, which is the internal
representation used by Date objects. Most programs will not have to
deal with TimeZone objects directly.</P>

<P>
<HR>
<p></P>

<H2><A NAME="textproc"></A>Text Processing</H2>

<H3>Formatting</H3>

<P>It is in formatting data for output that many cultural conventions
are applied. Numbers, dates, times, and messages may all require
formatting before they can be displayed. The Java platform provides a
set of flexible formatting classes that can handle both the standard
locale formats and programmer defined custom formats. These
formatting classes are also able to parse formatted strings back into
their constituent objects.</P>

<H4>Format Class</H4>

<P>The class <A HREF="../../../api/java/text/Format.html">Format</A> is
an abstract base class for formatting locale-sensitive information
such as dates, times, messages, and numbers. Three main subclasses
are provided: DateFormat, NumberFormat, and MessageFormat. These
three also provide subclasses of their own.</P>

<H4>DateFormat Class</H4>

<P>Dates and times are stored internally in a locale-independent way,
but should be formatted so that they can be displayed in a
locale-sensitive manner. For example, the same date might be
formatted as:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>November 3, 1997 (English)
   
   <LI>3 novembre 1997 (French)
</UL>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/DateFormat.html">DateFormat</A> is an
abstract base class for formatting and parsing date and time values
in a locale-independent manner. It has a number of static factory
methods for getting standard time formats for a given locale.</P>

<P>The DateFormat object uses Calendar and TimeZone objects in order
to interpret time values. By default, a DateFormat object for a given
locale will use the appropriate Calendar object for that locale and
the system's default TimeZone object. The programmer can override
these choices if desired.</P>

<H4>SimpleDateFormat Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat</A>
is a concrete class for formatting and parsing dates and times in a
locale-sensitive manner. It allows for formatting (milliseconds to
text), parsing (text to milliseconds), and normalization.</P>

<H4>DateFormatSymbols Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/DateFormatSymbols.html">DateFormatSymbols</A>
is used to encapsulate localizable date-time formatting data, such as
the names of the months, the names of the days of the week, time of
day, and the time zone data. The DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat
classes both use the DateFormatSymbols class to encapsulate this
information.</P>

<P>Usually, programmers will not use the DateFormatSymbols directly.
Rather, they will implement formatting with the DateFormat class's
factory methods.</P>

<H4>NumberFormat Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/NumberFormat.html">NumberFormat</A> is
an abstract base class for formatting and parsing numeric data. It
contains a number of static factory methods for getting different
kinds of locale-specific number formats.</P>

<P>The NumberFormat class helps programmers to format and parse
numbers for any locale. Code using this class can be completely
independent of the locale conventions for decimal points,
thousands-separators, the particular decimal digits used, or whether
the number format is even decimal. The application can also display a
number as a normal decimal number, currency, or percentage:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>1,234.5 (decimal number in U.S. format)
   
   <LI>$1,234.50 (U.S. currency in U.S. format)
   
   <LI>1.234,50 &#8364; (European currency in German format)
   
   <LI>123.450% (percent in German format)
</UL>

<H4>DecimalFormat Class</H4>

<P>Numbers are stored internally in a locale-independent way, but
should be formatted so that they can be displayed in a
locale-sensitive manner. For example, when using "#,###.00" as a
pattern, the same number might be formatted as:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>1.234,56 (German)
   
   <LI>1,234.56 (English)
</UL>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html">DecimalFormat</A>,
which is a concrete subclass of the NumberFormat class, can format
decimal numbers. Programmers generally will not instantiate this
class directly but will use the factory methods provided.</P>

<P>The DecimalFormat class has the ability to take a pattern string
to specify how a number should be formatted. The pattern specifies
attributes such as the precision of the number, whether leading zeros
should be printed, and what currency symbols are used. The pattern
string can be altered if a program needs to create a custom format.
</P>

<H4>DecimalFormatSymbols Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/DecimalFormatSymbols.html">DecimalFormatSymbols</A>
represents the set of symbols (such as the decimal separator, the
grouping separator, and so on) needed by DecimalFormat to format
numbers. DecimalFormat creates for itself an instance of
DecimalFormatSymbols from its locale data. A programmer needing to
change any of these symbols can get the DecimalFormatSymbols object
from the DecimalFormat object and then modify it.</P>

<H4>ChoiceFormat Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/ChoiceFormat.html">ChoiceFormat</A> is a
concrete subclass of the NumberFormat class. The ChoiceFormat class
allows the programmer to attach a format to a range of numbers. It is
generally used in a MessageFormat object for handling plurals. See
the "MessageFormat Class" section that follows for more information.
</P>

<H4>MessageFormat Class</H4>

<P>Programs often need to build messages from sequences of strings,
numbers and other data. For example, the text of a message displaying
the number of files on a disk drive will vary:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The disk C contains 100 files.
   
   <LI>The disk D contains 1 file.
   
   <LI>The disk F contains 0 files.
</UL>

<P>If a message built from sequences of strings and numbers is
hard-coded, it cannot be translated into other languages. For
example, note the different positions of the parameters "3" and "G"
in the following translations:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The disk G contains 3 files. (English)
   
   <LI>Il y a 3 fichiers sur le disque G. (French)
</UL>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">MessageFormat</A>
provides a means to produce concatenated messages in language-neutral
way. The MessageFormat object takes a set of objects, formats them,
and then inserts the formatted strings into the pattern at the
appropriate places.</P>

<H4>ParsePosition Class</H4>

<P>The class
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/ParsePosition.html">ParsePosition</A> is
used by the Format class and its subclasses to keep track of the
current position during parsing. The parseObject() method in the
Format class requires a ParsePosition object as an argument.</P>

<H4>FieldPosition Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/FieldPosition.html">FieldPosition</A>
class is used by the Format class and its subclasses to identify
fields in formatted output. One version of the format() method in the
Format class requires a FieldPosition object as an argument.</P>

<H3>Locale-Sensitive String Operations</H3>

<P>Programs frequently need to manipulate strings. Common operations
on strings include searching and sorting. Some tasks, such as
collating strings or finding various boundaries in text, are
surprisingly difficult to get right and are even more difficult when
multiple languages must be considered. The Java Platform provides
classes for handling many of these common string manipulations in a
locale-sensitive manner.</P>

<H4>Collator Class</H4>

<P>The <A HREF="../../../api/java/text/Collator.html">Collator</A> class
performs locale-sensitive string comparison. Programmers use this
class to build searching and alphabetical sorting routines for
natural language text. Collator is an abstract base class. Its
subclasses implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
RuleBasedCollator, is currently provided with the Java Platform and
is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other subclasses may be
created to handle more specialized needs.</P>

<H4>RuleBasedCollator Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/RuleBasedCollator.html">RuleBasedCollator</A>
class, which is a concrete subclass of the Collator class, provides a
simple, data-driven, table collator. Using RuleBasedCollator, a
programmer can create a customized table-based collator. For example,
a programmer can build a collator that will ignore (or notice)
uppercase letters, accents, and Unicode combining characters.</P>

<H4>CollationElementIterator Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/CollationElementIterator.html">CollationElementIterator</A>
class is used as an iterator to walk through each character of an
international string. Programmers use the iterator to return the
ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering priority
of a character, or key, defines how a character is collated in the
given Collator object. The CollationElementIterator class is used by
the compare() method of the RuleBasedCollator class.</P>

<H4>CollationKey Class</H4>

<P>A <A HREF="../../../api/java/text/CollationKey.html">CollationKey</A>
object represents a string under the rules of a specific Collator
object. Comparing two CollationKey objects returns the relative order
of the strings they represent. Using CollationKey objects to compare
strings is generally faster than using the Collator.compare() method.
Thus, when the strings must be compared multiple times, for example
when sorting a list of strings, it is more efficient to use
CollationKey objects.</P>

<H4>BreakIterator Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/BreakIterator.html">BreakIterator</A>
class indirectly implements methods for finding the position of the
following types of boundaries in a string of text:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>potential line break
   
   <LI>sentence
   
   <LI>word
   
   <LI>character
</UL>

<P>The conventions on where to break lines, sentences, words, and
characters vary from one language to another. Since the BreakIterator
class is locale-sensitive, it can be used by programs that perform
text operations. For example, consider a a word processing program
that can highlight a character, cut a word, move the cursor to the
next sentence, or word-wrap at a line ending. This word processing
program would use break iterators to determine the logical boundaries
in text, enabling it to perform text operations in a locale-sensitive
manner.</P>

<H4>StringCharacterIterator Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/StringCharacterIterator.html">StringCharacterIterator</A>
class provides the ability to iterate over a string of Unicode
characters in a bidirectional manner. This class uses a cursor to
move within a range of text, and can return individual characters or
their index values. The StringCharacterIterator class implements the
character iterator functionality of the CharacterIterator interface.
</P>

<H4>CharacterIterator Interface</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/CharacterIterator.html">CharacterIterator</A>
interface defines a protocol for bidirectional iteration over Unicode
characters. Classes should implement this interface if they want to
move about within a range of text and return individual Unicode
characters or their index values. CharacterIterator is for searching
is useful when performing character searches.</P>

<H4>Normalizer Class</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/text/Normalizer.html">Normalizer</A> class
provides methods to transform Unicode text into an equivalent composed or
decomposed form.  The class supports the <I>Unicode Normalization
Forms</I> defined by the Unicode standard.</P>

<P>
<HR>
<p></P>

<H2><A NAME="pluggablelocales"></A>Locale Sensitive Services SPIs</H2>

<P>Locale sensitive services provided by classes in the java.text and
java.util packages can be extended by implementing <i>Locale Sensitive
Services SPIs</i> for locales the Java runtime has not yet supported.
In addition to localized symbols or names for the
<A HREF="../../../api/java/util/Currency.html">Currency</A>,

<H2><A NAME="conversion"></A>Character Encoding Conversion</H2>

<P>The Java platform uses Unicode as its native character encoding;
however, many Java programs still need to handle text data in other
encodings. Java therefore provides a set of classes that convert many
standard character encodings to and from Unicode. Java programs that
need to deal with non-Unicode text data convert that data into
Unicode, process the data as Unicode, then convert the result back to
the external character encoding. The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/io/InputStreamReader.html">InputStreamReader</A>
and
<A HREF="../../../api/java/io/OutputStreamWriter.html">OutputStreamWriter</A>
classes provide methods that can convert between other character
encodings and Unicode.</P>

<H4>Supported Encodings</H4>

<P>The InputStreamReader, OutputStreamWriter, and String classes can
convert between Unicode and the set of character encodings listed in
the web page <A HREF="encoding.doc.html">Supported Encodings</A>.
</P>

<H4>Stream I/O</H4>

<P>The Java Platform provides features in the java.io package to
improve the handling of character data: the Reader and Writer
classes, and an enhancement to the PrintStream class.</P>

<H4>Reader and Writer Classes</H4>

<P>The <A HREF="../../../api/java/io/Reader.html">Reader</A> and
<A HREF="../../../api/java/io/Writer.html">Writer</A> class hierarchies
provide the ability to perform I/O operations on character streams.
These hierarchies parallel the InputStream and OutputStream class
hierarchies, but operate on streams of characters rather than streams
of bytes. Character streams make it easy to write programs that are
not dependent upon a specific character encoding, and are therefore
easier to internationalize. The Reader and Writer classes also have
the ability to convert between Unicode and other character encodings.
Please refer to the <A HREF="../io/io.html"> Character Streams</A>
document for more information about the Reader and Writer class
hierarchies.</P>

<H4>PrintStream Class</H4>

<P>The <A HREF="../../../api/java/io/PrintStream.html">PrintStream</A>
class produces output using the system's default character encoding
and line terminator. This change allows methods such as
System.out.println() to act more reasonably with non-ASCII data.</P>

<H4>Charset Package</H4>

<P>The
<A HREF="../../../api/java/nio/charset/package-summary.html">java.nio.charset</A>
package provides the underpinnings for character encoding conversion.
Applications can use its classes to fine-tune the behavior of
built-in character converters. Developers can also create custom
converters for character encodings that are not supported by built-in
character converters, using the java.nio.charset.spi package.</P>

<H2><A NAME="input"></A>Text Input</H2>

<H4><A NAME="inputmethod"></A>Input Methods</H4>

<P>Input methods are software components that let the user enter text
in ways other than simple typing on a keyboard. They are commonly
used to enter Japanese, Chinese, or Korean - languages using
thousands of different characters - on keyboards with far fewer keys.
However, the Java platform also supports input methods for other
languages and the use of entirely different input mechanisms, such as
handwriting or speech recognition.</P>

<P>The Java platform enables the use of native input methods
provided by the host operating system, such as Windows or Solaris, as
well as the implementation and use of input methods written in the
Java programming language.</P>

<P>The term input methods does not refer to class methods of the Java
programming language.</P>

<H4>Input Method Support in Swing</H4>

<P>The Swing text components provide an integrated user interface for
text input using input methods. Depending on the locale, one of two
input styles is used. With on-the-spot (inline) input, the style used
for most locales, the input methods insert the text directly into the
text component while the text is being composed. With below-the-spot
input, the style used for Chinese locales, a separate composition
window is used, which is positioned automatically to be near the
point where the text is to be inserted after being committed.</P>

<P>An application using Swing text components does not have to
coordinate the interaction between the text components and input
methods. However, it should call
<A HREF="../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#endComposition()">InputContext.endComposition</A>
when all text must be committed, such as when a document is saved or
printed.</P>

<H4>Input Method Framework</H4>

<P>The input method framework enables the collaboration between text
editing components and input methods in entering text. Programmers
who develop text editing components or input methods use this
framework. Other application developers generally make only minimal
use of it. For example, they should call
<A HREF="../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#endComposition()">InputContext.endComposition</A>
when all text must be committed, such as when a document is saved or
printed.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../imf/index.html">Input Method Framework</A> web
page contains links to the specifications and API documentation.</P>
