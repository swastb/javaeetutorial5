<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Java 2 platform includes a new package of <i>concurrency utilities</i>.
These are classes which are designed to be used as building blocks in building
concurrent classes or applications. Just as the Collections Framework
greatly simplified the organization and manipulation of in-memory data by
providing implementations of commonly used data structures, the Concurrency
Utilities aims to simplify the development of concurrent classes by providing
implementations of building blocks commonly used in concurrent designs.
The Concurrency Utilities include a high-performance, flexible thread pool; a
framework for asynchronous execution of tasks; a host of collection classes
optimized for concurrent access; synchronization utilities such as counting
semaphores; atomic variables; locks; and condition variables.
<p>

Using the Concurrency Utilities, instead of developing components such as
thread pools yourself, offers a number of advantages:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced programming effort.</strong> It is far easier to use
    a standard class than to develop it yourself.

  <li><strong>Increased performance.</strong> The implementations in the
    Concurrency Utilities were developed and peer-reviewed by concurrency and
    performance experts; these implementations are likely to be faster and more
    scalable than a typical implementation, even by a skilled developer.

  <li><strong>Increased reliability.</strong> Developing concurrent
    classes is difficult -- the low-level concurrency primitives provided by the
    Java language (<code>synchronized</code>, <code>volatile</code>, 
    <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code>)
    are difficult to use correctly, and errors using these facilities can be
    difficult to detect and debug. By using standardized, extensively
    tested concurrency building blocks, many potential sources of threading 
    hazards such as deadlock, starvation, race conditions, or excessive context 
    switching are eliminated. The concurrency utilities have been 
    carefully audited for deadlock, starvation, and race conditions. 

  <li><strong>Improved maintainability. </strong>Programs which use standard
    library classes are easier to understand and maintain than those which rely
    on complicated, homegrown classes.

  <li><strong>Increased productivity.</strong> Developers are likely to
    already understand the standard library classes, so there is no need to
    learn the API and behavior of ad-hoc concurrent components.
    Additionally, concurrent applications are far simpler to debug when they are
    built on reliable, well-tested components.
</ul>
<p>

In short, using the Concurrency Utilities to implement a concurrent
application can help you make your program clearer, shorter, faster, more
reliable, more scalable, easier to write, easier to read, and easier to
maintain.
<p>

The Concurrency Utilities includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Task Scheduling Framework</strong> - The 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html"><code>Executor</code></a>
    framework is a framework for standardizing invocation, scheduling,
    execution, and control of asynchronous tasks according to a set of execution
    policies. Implementations are provided that allow tasks to be executed
    within the submitting thread, in a 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newSingleThreadExecutor()">single 
    background thread</a> (as with events in Swing), in a newly created 
    thread, or in a 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newFixedThreadPool(int)">thread pool</a>,
    and developers can create 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/AbstractExecutorService.html"customized implementations</a>
    of Executor supporting arbitrary execution policies. The built-in 
    implementations offer configurable policies such as queue length 
    limits and 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/RejectedExecutionHandler.html">saturation policy</a> 
    which can improve the stability of applications by preventing runaway 
    resource consumption.

  <li><strong>Concurrent Collections</strong> - Several new Collections classes
    have been added, including the new 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code></a> 
    and 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html"><code>BlockingQueue</code></a>
    interfaces, and high-performance, concurrent implementations of <code>Map</code>,
    <code>List</code>, and <code>Queue</code>.

  <li><strong>Atomic Variables</strong> - Classes for atomically manipulating
    single variables (primitive types or references), providing high-performance
    atomic arithmetic and compare-and-set methods. The atomic variable
    implementations in 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html#package_description"><code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code></a>
    offer higher performance than would be available by using synchronization 
    (on most platforms), making them useful for implementing high-performance 
    concurrent algorithms as well as conveniently implementing counters and 
    sequence number generators.

  <li><strong>Synchronizers</strong> - General purpose synchronization classes,
    including
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html">semaphores</a>, 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html">mutexes</a>, 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html">barriers</a>, 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html">latches</a>, and 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/Exchanger.html">exchangers</a>, 
    which facilitate coordination between threads.

  <li><strong>Locks</strong> - While locking is built into the Java language via
    the synchronized keyword, there are a number of inconvenient limitations to
    built-in monitor locks. The 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html#package_description"><code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code></a> package
    provides a high-performance lock implementation with the same memory
    semantics as synchronization, but which also supports specifying a timeout
    when attempting to acquire a lock, multiple condition variables per lock,
    non-lexically scoped locks, and support for interrupting threads which are
    waiting to acquire a lock.

  <li><strong>Nanosecond-granularity timing</strong> - The 
    <a href="../../api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()"><code>System.nanoTime</code></a>
    method enables access to a nanosecond-granularity time source for making
    relative time measurements, and methods which accept timeouts (such as the 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html#offer(E)"<code>BlockingQueue.offer</code></a>,
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html#poll(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)"><code>BlockingQueue.poll</code></a>, 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock()"><code>Lock.tryLock</code></a>, 
    <a href="../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html#await()"><code>Condition.await</code></a>,
    and <a href="../../api/java/lang/Thread.html#sleep(long)"><code>Thread.sleep</code></a>) 
    can take timeout values in nanoseconds.
    The actual precision of <code>System.nanoTime</code> is platform-dependent.
</ul>
