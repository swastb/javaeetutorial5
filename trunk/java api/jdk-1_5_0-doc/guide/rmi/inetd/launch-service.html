<p>On the Solaris Operating System (Solaris OS), the Internet
services daemon <code>inetd</code> provides an 
alternative to starting up services at system boot time.  This
daemon, a server process for Internet standard services,
can be configured to start services on demand.  For details on
the Internet services daemon, see the  Solaris OS
<code>inetd(1M)</code> man page.

</p><p>As of the J2SE 5.0 release, <code>inetd</code> can be
configured to start Java RMI services on demand.  An application,
however, must use a specific technique to enable that application and
its constituent services to be started from <code>inetd</code>.
First, the service program should create a local registry, exported to
use the I/O socket inherited from <code>inetd</code>.  The service
program should then bind the service's proxy in this
specially exported registry so that clients can look up the service.
Once the service program is complete, <code>inetd</code> can be
configured to start this program when a client attempts to connect to
the service's local registry in order to look up the service by name.

</p><p>This tutorial first describes how to structure a
service program (employing a specially exported local registry)
so that the service can be started from <code>inetd</code> when
clients connect to the service's local registry.

</p><p>Next, the tutorial describes how to configure
<code>inetd</code> to launch the service program.  You will need to
add an entry to each of two configuration files that
<code>inetd</code> uses, <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> and
<code>/etc/services</code>.  Editing these files requires root access
to the machine that the service will run on.

</p><p>After <code>inetd</code> has been reconfigured, you should 
test your configuration to make sure that it works properly.

</p><p>This tutorial has the following steps:

<h2>
<a name="1"></a>Implement the service program</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The server-side implementation uses the following source files:
<ul>
<li><code><a href="ServiceInterface.java">ServiceInterface.java</a></code>:
remote interface for the service
<li><code><a href="InitializeRegistry.java">InitializeRegistry.java</a></code>:
utility to create/export a registry using an inherited channel
<li><code><a href="Server.java">Server.java</a></code>: service program
</ul>

The interface <code>ServiceInterface</code> defines a remote interface
with a single method <code>sendMessage</code> specified to take a single
argument, <code>message</code>, and return an acknowledgment that the
message was received.

</p><p>The class <code>InitializeRegistry</code> defines a static
utility method <code>initializeWithInheritedChannel</code> that
creates and exports a registry (using an inherited channel, if any),
and binds a remote service's proxy in that registry for clients to
look up.

</p><p>The service program <code>Server</code> implements the
interface <code>ServiceInterface</code> and defines a static
<code>main</code> method for running the service.  The static
<code>main</code> method does the following:

<ul>
<li>Redirects <code>System.err</code> output to a file, in order to prevent the
error output from being lost in the case that the service program is
started from <code>inetd</code>.
<li>Parses the optional argument, which is the port number for the
local registry.
<li>Creates and exports the server on an anonymous port.
<li>Invokes the <code>InitializeRegistry.initializeWithInheritedChannel</code>
utility method with the service's proxy, the name for the service in
the registry, and an optional port number to use if the program is run
from the command line instead of being started from
<code>inetd</code>.
<li>Prints out the message <code>ready</code>.
<li>Waits forever.
</ul>

</p><p>The most interesting part of the implementation is in the
<code>initializeWithInheritedChannel</code> utility method.  This
method uses the <code>System.inheritedChannel</code> method which
allows an application to obtain a channel
(<code>java.nio.channels.SocketChannel</code> or
<code>java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel</code>, for example)
inherited from a process that launched the virtual machine.  Such
an inherited channel can be used to either service a single
incoming connection (in the case of a
<code>SocketChannel</code>), or accept multiple incoming
connections (in the case of <code>ServerSocketChannel</code>).
In this way, applications launched by <code>inetd</code> can
obtain the <code>SocketChannel</code> or
<code>ServerSocketChannel</code> inherited from
<code>inetd</code>.

</p><p>The <code>initializeWithInheritedChannel</code> utility method
first invokes the <code>System.inheritedChannel</code> method to obtain the
inherited channel.  The inherited channel must either be
<code>null</code> or a <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> or the
method will throw an <code>IOException</code>.

</p><p>If the inherited channel is <code>null</code>,
there is no inherited channel; that is, the program was run from the command
line.  In this case, the <code>initializeWithInheritedChannel</code>
method simply exports a registry on the specified port (which must be
nonzero) and binds the specified service proxy in that registry.

</p><p>If the inherited channel is a
<code>ServerSocketChannel</code> instance, then the program was
started from <code>inetd</code>.  In this case, the
<code>initializeWithInheritedChannel</code> method exports a
registry with an <code>RMIServerSocketFactory</code> whose
<code>createServerSocket</code> method returns a
<code>ServerSocket</code> that delays accepting requests from the
inherited <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> until the specified
proxy is bound in the registry.

</p><p>In the case that the program is started from
<code>inetd</code>, it is important that the registry not accept any
incoming connections on the inherited <code>ServerSocket</code> until the
service's proxy is bound in the local registry.  If a connection is
accepted before the service is bound in the registry, a client
might receive a <code>java.rmi.NotBoundException</code> from
attempting to look up the service proxy.

</p><p>For details on how to implement a <code>ServerSocket</code>
that delays accepting requests until a service is bound in the
registry, see the private nested class
<code>DelayedAcceptServerSocket</code> defined in the <code><a
href="InitializeRegistry.java">InitializeRegistry</a></code> class.

</p><p>Compile the service program as follows:


<blockquote>
<pre>
% javac -d <b><i>classDir</i></b> ServiceInterface.java InitializeRegistry.java Server.java
</pre>
</blockquote>

where <b><i>classDir</i></b> is the class path for this example.

</p><p>Note that if the service needs to be accessible to clients
running on releases earlier than J2SE 5.0, you will need to use
<code>rmic</code> to generate a stub for the remote service.

</p><p>The next three sections describe how to set up
<code>inetd</code> to start the service program.
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a name="2"></a>Configure <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> configuration file contains
entries for the services to be launched when <code>inetd</code>
receives a request over a socket.  For details on the format of
this configuration file see the Solaris OS
<code>inetd.conf(4)</code> man page. 

</p><p>
To configure <code>inetd</code> to launch the service program, add
the following entry to the <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>
configuration file (requires root access to the machine):
<blockquote>
<pre>
example-server stream tcp wait nobody <i><b>jreHome</b></i>/bin/java  \
     java -classpath <b><i>classpath</i></b> example.inetd.Server
</pre>
</blockquote>
where <i><b>jreHome</b></i> is a path to the installed JRE, and
<b><i>classpath</i></b> is the class path for the example.

</p><p>If the program needs to be run as a user other than
<code>nobody</code>, replace <code>nobody</code> above with the
user ID under which the program should run.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="3"></a>Configure <code>/etc/services</code></h2>
<blockquote>

<p>Next, the name chosen to refer to the service,
<code>example-server</code>, needs to be listed as a service in the
<code>/etc/services</code> configuration file. For details on the
format of this configuration file see the Solaris OS
<code>services(4)</code> man page.

</p><p>To list <code>example-server</code> as a service, add the
following entry to the <code>/etc/services</code> configuration file
(requires root access to the machine):

<blockquote>
<pre>
example-server        <b><i>port</i></b>/tcp
</pre>
</blockquote>

where <b><i>port</i></b> is the port number for the service's local
registry.

</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="4"></a>Force <code>inetd</code> to read its new configuration</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Now that the configuration has been modified,
<code>inetd</code> needs to read the new configuration so that it
can listen on the appropriate ports for the services that are
configured.

</p><p>But first, it is important to make sure that the service
program is not already running.  To do this, run the following
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% ps -ef | grep example.inetd.Server
</pre>
</blockquote>
If the above command does not print out the information for a running
<code>java</code> process for the service program, then the program is not
running.  If it does, then you will need to terminate the program
first before continuing.

</p><p>Next, <code>inetd</code> needs to read its new
configuration.  To force <code>inetd</code> to reread its
configuration, the running <code>inetd</code> process must be sent 
a hangup signal.   First, find the process ID for the 
running <code>inetd</code> process by running the following
command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% ps -ef | grep inetd
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will print out something like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
root   171     1  0   Sep 30 ?        0:02 /usr/sbin/inetd -s
</pre>
</blockquote>
In this example, the process ID for <code>inetd</code> is <code>171</code>.
Now, the <code>inetd</code> process can be sent a hangup signal 
by running the following command and supplying the process ID
(requires root access):
<blockquote>
<pre>
% kill -HUP 171
</pre>
</blockquote>

</p></p>Now, <code>inetd</code> is all set to launch
the service program when a client attempts to connect to the port
configured above.
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="5"></a>Test your configuration using a simple client</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>To test that <code>inetd</code> is configured properly, you can run
a simple client program that looks up the service in the registry on
the port configured above, and then invokes a method on the service.
Attempting to connect to the service's local registry will, in turn,
cause <code>inetd</code> to launch the service program if the
configuration is correct.

</p><p>The following is a simple program to look up the
service and invoke a method on the service to send it a message.  The
program takes three command-line arguments, the host and port of the
service's local registry, and the message to send to the service:

<blockquote>
<pre>
package example.inetd;

import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

	int port = 0;
	String host = "";
	String message = "";
	
	if (args.length > 2) {
	    host = args[0];
	    try {
		port = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
		if (port == 0) {
		    goodbye("nonzero port argument required", null);
		}
	    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
		goodbye("malformed port argument", e);
	    }
	    message = args[2];
	} else {
	    usage();
	}

	Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(host, port);
	ServiceInterface proxy =
	    (ServiceInterface) registry.lookup("ServiceInterface");
	System.out.println("sending message: " + message);
	System.out.println("received message from proxy: " +
			   proxy.sendMessage(message));
	
	System.out.println("done.");
    }

    private static void goodbye(String message, Exception e) {
	System.err.println("Client: " + message + (e != null ? ": " : ""));
	if (e != null) {
	    e.printStackTrace();
	}
	System.exit(1);
    }

    private static void usage() {
	System.err.println("Client &LT;host&GT; &LT;port&GT; &LT;message&GT;");
	System.exit(1);
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p><p>The full source (including comments) for the client is:
<ul>
<li><code><a href="Client.java">ServiceInterface.java</a></code>:
remote interface for the service
<li><code><a href="Client.java">Client.java</a></code>: client program
</ul>
</p><p>Compile and run this program as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% javac -d <b><i>classDir</i></b> ServiceInterface.java Client.java
% java -classpath <b><i>classDir</i></b> example.inetd.Client <b><i>host</i></b> <b><i>port</i></b> "<b><i>message</i></b>"
</pre>
</blockquote>

where <b><i>classDir</i></b> is the class path for this example,
<b><i>host</i></b> is the host that the service is configured to run on,
 <b><i>port</i></b> is the port <a href="#3">configured for the
service</a> in the <code>/etc/services</code> file</a>, and
<b><i>message</i></b> is a string to send to the service.

</p><p>If the client program prints out that it sent a message to and
received a message from the service, then the service program was
successfully launched by <code>inetd</code>.

</p><p>If the client program either hangs or prints an exception trace,
check the output produced by the service program.  The service
program redirects any output written to <code>System.err</code> to  a
file located in the directory specified by the property
<code>java.io.tmpdir</code>, typically <code>/var/tmp</code> on
the Solaris OS.  The output file is prefixed with
"example-server-err" and has the suffix of ".tmp".  The file name also
contains other characters (typically numbers) in between to keep
the file name unique.

</p><p>If the service program starts up successfully from
<code>inetd</code>, the output file should contain the text
"<code>ready</code>" with no warning or error messages.

</p><p>If the file does not exist, the "<code>ready</code>" message is
not in the file, or additional error output is in the file, then
recheck the configuration.  Upon changing the <code>inetd</code>
configuration, remember to send <code>inetd</code> a hangup signal so
that it rereads its altered configuration, and remember to terminate
any process started from the previous attempt before continuing.
