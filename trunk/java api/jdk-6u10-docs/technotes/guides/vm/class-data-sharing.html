<h2>Class Data Sharing</h2>
</center>

<b>Overview</b>
<p> 

Class data sharing (CDS) is a new feature in J2SE 5.0 intended to
reduce the startup time for Java programming language applications, in 
particular smaller applications, as well as reduce footprint. When the 
JRE is installed on 32-bit platforms using the Sun provided installer, 
the installer loads a set of classes from the system jar file into a private internal 
representation, and dumps that representation to a file, called a 
"shared archive".  
Class data sharing is not supported in Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME. 
If the Sun JRE installer is not being used, this can 
be done manually, as explained below. During subsequent JVM 
invocations, the shared archive is memory-mapped in, saving the cost 
of loading those classes and allowing much of the JVM's metadata for 
these classes to be shared among multiple JVM processes. 
<p>
In J2SE 5.0, class data sharing is supported only with the Java HotSpot
Client VM, and only with the serial garbage collector. 
<p>

The primary motivation for including CDS in the 5.0 release is the
decrease in startup time it provides. CDS produces better results for
smaller applications because it eliminates a fixed cost: that of
loading certain core classes. The smaller the application relative to
the number of core classes it uses, the larger the saved fraction of
startup time.
<p> 

The footprint cost of new JVM instances has been reduced in two ways. 
First, a portion of the shared archive, currently between five and six 
megabytes, is mapped read-only and therefore shared among multiple JVM 
processes. Previously this data was replicated in each JVM instance. 
Second, since the shared archive contains class data in the form in which 
the Java Hotspot VM uses it, the memory which would otherwise 
be required to access the original class information in <code>rt.jar</code> 
is not needed. These savings allow 
more applications to be run concurrently on the same machine. 
On Microsoft Windows, the footprint of a process, as measured 
by various tools, may appear to increase, because a larger number of pages are 
being mapped in to the process' address space. This is offset by the reduction 
in the amount of memory (inside Microsoft Windows) which is needed to hold portions 
on <code>rt.jar</code>. Reducing footprint remains a high priority. 
<p>


<b>Regenerating the Shared Archive</b>
<p>

Under some circumstances the system administrator may need to manually
regenerate the shared archive. This is typically only necessary on
Solaris if the Java SE packages were installed over the network to a
machine of a different architecture than that performing the
installation. Regardless, these regeneration instructions apply to all
supported platforms.
<p>

The shared archive file is colocated with the shared library for the
JVM. On Unix platforms, it is stored in
<code>jre/lib/[arch]/client/classes.jsa</code> and on Microsoft Windows platforms in
<code>jre/bin/client/classes.jsa</code>. If this file exists, it must be manually
removed before regeneration.
<p>

To regenerate the archive, log in as the administrator; in networked
situations, log on to a machine of the same architecture as the J2SE
installation and ensure that you have permission to write to the
installation directory. Then execute the command

<blockquote>
   <code>java -Xshare:dump</code>
</blockquote>

Diagnostic information will be printed as the archive is generated.

<h3>Manually Controlling Class Data Sharing</h3>
<p>

The class data sharing feature is automatically enabled when
conditions allow it to be used. The following command line options are
present primarily for diagnostic and debugging purposes and may change
or be removed in future releases.

<dl>
<dt><code>-Xshare:off</code>

  <dd>Disable class data sharing.

<dt><code>-Xshare:on</code>

  <dd>Require class data sharing to be enabled. If it could not be
      enabled for various reasons, print an error message and exit.

<dt><code>-Xshare:auto</code>

  <dd>The default; enable class data sharing whenever possible.
</dl>
