<H2>1.0 Introduction</H2>
<P>The Java platform defines a set of programming interfaces for performing 
cryptographic operations. These interfaces are collectively known as the Java 
Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), and 
are specified at the  <A 
href="index.html">Security in J2SE 5 home page</A>. 
</P>
<P>The cryptographic interfaces are provider-based. Specifically, applications 
talk to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and the actual cryptographic 
operations are performed in configured providers which adhere to a set of 
Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs). This architecture supports different 
provider implementations. Some providers may perform cryptographic operations in 
software; others may perform the operations on a hardware token (for example, on 
a smartcard device or on a hardware cryptographic accelerator). </P>
<P>The Cryptographic Token Interface Standard, PKCS#11, is produced by RSA 
Security and defines native programming interfaces to cryptographic tokens, such 
as hardware cryptographic accelerators and Smartcards. To facilitate the 
integration of native PKCS#11 tokens into the Java platform, a new cryptographic 
provider, the Sun PKCS#11 provider, has been introduced into the J2SE 5.0
release. This new provider enables existing applications written to the JCA and 
JCE APIs to access native PKCS#11 tokens. No modifications to the application 
are required. The only requirement is the proper configuration of the provider 
into the Java Runtime. 
<P><A name=NEWAPIS></A>Although an application can make use of most PKCS#11 
features using existing APIs, some applications might need more flexibility and 
capabilities. For example, an application might want to deal with Smartcards 
being removed and inserted dynamically more easily. Or, a PKCS#11 token might 
require authentication for some non-key-related operations and therefore, the 
application must be able to log into the token without using keystore. In J2SE 5.0,
the JCA was enhanced to allow applications greater flexibility in dealing with 
different providers. 
<P>This document describes how native PKCS#11 tokens can be configured into the 
Java platform for use by Java applications. It also describes the enhancements 
that were made to the JCA to make it easier for applications to deal with 
different types of providers, including PKCS#11 providers. </P><A 
name=P11Provider></A>
<H3>2.0 Sun PKCS#11 Provider</H3>
<P>The Sun PKCS#11 provider, in contrast to most other providers, does not 
implement cryptographic algorithms itself. Instead, it acts as a bridge between 
the Java JCA and JCE APIs and the native PKCS#11 cryptographic API, translating 
the calls and conventions between the two. This means that Java applications 
calling standard JCA and JCE APIs can, without modification, take advantage of 
algorithms offered by the underlying PKCS#11 implementations, such as, for 
example, 
<UL>
  <LI>Cryptographic Smartcards, 
  <LI>Hardware cryptographic accelerators, and 
  <LI>High performance software implementations. </LI></UL>Note that Java SE only 
facilitates accessing native PKCS#11 implementations, it does not itself include 
a native PKCS#11 implementation. However, cryptographic devices such as 
Smartcards and hardware accelerators often come with software that includes a 
PKCS#11 implementation, which you need to install and configure according to 
manufacturer's instructions. 

<BLOCKQUOTE><A name=Requirements></A>
  <H3>2.1 Requirements</H3>The Sun PKCS#11 provider is supported on
  Solaris (SPARC and x86) and Linux (x86) in both 32-bit and 64-bit Java
  processes. It is also supported on 32-bit Windows (x86) but not currently
  on 64-bit Windows platforms due to the lack of suitable PKCS#11 libraries.

  <P>The Sun PKCS#11 provider requires an implementation of PKCS#11 v2.0 or 
  later to be installed on the system. This implementation must take the form of 
  a shared-object library (.so on Solaris and Linux) or dynamic-link library 
  (.dll on Windows). Please consult your vendor documentation to find out if 
  your cryptographic device includes such a PKCS#11 implementation, how to 
  configure it, and what the name of the library file is. 
  <P>The Sun PKCS#11 provider supports a number of algorithms, provided that the 
  underlying PKCS#11 implementation offers them. The algorithms and their 
  corresponding PKCS#11 mechanisms are listed in the table in 
  <a href="#ALG">Appendix A</a>.
  
  <A name=Config></A>
  <H3>2.2 Configuration</H3>
  The Sun PKCS#11 provider is implemented by the main 
  class <CODE>sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11</CODE> and accepts the full pathname 
  of a configuration file as an argument. To use the provider, you must first 
  install it by using the <A 
  href="crypto/CryptoSpec.html#ProviderInstalling">Java 
  Cryptography Architecture</A> (JCA). As with all JCA providers, installation 
  of the provider can be done either statically or programmatically. To install 
  the provider statically, add the provider to the Java Security properties file 
  (<TT>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security</TT>). For example, here's a 
  fragment of the <TT>java.security</TT> file that installs the Sun PKCS#11 
  provider with the configuration file <TT>/opt/bar/cfg/pkcs11.cfg</TT>. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># configuration for security providers 1-6 ommitted
security.provider.7=sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 /opt/bar/cfg/pkcs11.cfg
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>To install the provider dynamically, create an instance of 
  the provider with the appropriate configuration filename and then install it. 
  Here is an example. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>String configName = "/opt/bar/cfg/pkcs11.cfg";
Provider p = new sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11(configName);
Security.addProvider(p);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>To use more than one slot per PKCS#11 implementation, or to use more than 
  one PKCS#11 implementation, simply repeat the installation for each with the 
  appropriate configuration file. This will result in a Sun PKCS#11 provider 
  instance for each slot of each PKCS#11 implementation. 

<p>
The configuration file is a text file that contains entries in the following
format.
<blockquote>
<em>attribute</em> = <em>value</em>
</blockquote>
The valid values for <em>attribute</em> and <em>value</em>
are described in the table in this section.
The two mandatory attributes are
<tt>name</tt> and <tt>library</tt>.
Here is a sample configuration file.
<blockquote>
<pre>
name = FooAccelerator
library = /opt/foo/lib/libpkcs11.so
</pre>
</blockquote>
Comments are denoted by lines starting with the <tt>#</tt> (number) symbol.

<!--<strong>
<blockquote>
??? Format questions:
1. Leading spaces ignored?
2. Trailing spaces ignored?
3. Spaces surrounding '=' mandatory or optional?

<H4>Attributes Configuration</h4>

The attributes option allows you to specify additional PKCS#11 attributes
that should be set when creating PKCS#11 key objects. By default, the
SunPKCS11 provider only specifies mandatory PKCS#11 attributes when creating
objects. For example, for RSA public keys it specifies the key type and
algorithm (CKA_CLASS and CKA_KEY_TYPE) and the key values for RSA public
keys (CKA_MODULUS and CKA_PUBLIC_EXPONENT). The PKCS#11 library you are
using will assign implementation specific default values to the other
attributes of an RSA public key, for example that the key can be used
to encrypt and verify messages (CKA_ENCRYPT and CKA_VERIFY = true).

<p>
The <tt>attributes</tt> option can be used if you do not like the default values
your PKCS#11 implementation assigns or if your PKCS#11 implementation
does not support defaults and requires a value to be specified explicitly.
Note that specifying attributes that your PKCS#11 implementation does not
support or that are invalid for the type of key in question may cause
the operation to fail at runtime.

<p>
The option can be specified
zero or more times, the options are processed in the order specified
in the configuration file as described below.

The <tt>attributes</tt> option has the format:

<blockquote>
<pre>
attributes(operation, keytype, keyalgorithm) = {
  name1 = value1
  [...]
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Valid values for <tt>operation</tt> are:
<ul>

<li><tt>generate</tt>, for keys generated via a KeyPairGenerator
or KeyGenerator

<p>
<li><tt>import</tt>, for keys created via a KeyFactory or SecretKeyFactory.
This also applies to Java software keys automatically converted to PKCS#11 key
objects when they are passed to the initialization method of a cryptographic
operation, for example <tt>Signature.initSign()</tt>.

<p>
<li><tt>*</tt>, for keys created using either a generate or a create operation.

</ul>

Valid values for <tt>keytype</tt> are <tt>CKO_PUBLIC_KEY</tt>, <tt>CKO_PRIVATE_KEY</tt>,
and <tt>CKO_SECRET_KEY</tt>, for public, private, and secret keys, respectively,
and <tt>*</tt> to match any type of key.

<p>
Valid values for <tt>keyalgorithm</tt> are one of the <tt>CKK_xxx</tt> constants
from the PKCS#11 specification, or <tt>*</tt> to match keys of any algorithm.
The algorithms currently supported by the SunPKCS11 provider are
CKK_RSA, CKK_DSA, CKK_DH, CKK_AES, CKK_DES, CKK_DES3, CKK_RC4, CKK_BLOWFISH,
and CKK_GENERIC.

<p>
The attribute names and values are specified as a list of one or more name-value
pairs. <tt>name</tt> must be a <tt>CKA_xxx</tt> constant from the PKCS#11
specification, for example <tt>CKA_SENSITIVE</tt>. <tt>value</tt> can be one of
the following:

<ul>
<li>a boolean value, <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>
<li>an integer, in decimal form (default) or in hexadecimal form
if it begins with <tt>0x</tt>.
<li><tt>null</tt>, indicating that this attribute should <em>not</em> be
specified when creating objects.

</ul>

If the <tt>attributes</tt> option is specified multiple times, the entries are
processed in the order specified with the attributes aggregated and later
attributes overriding earlier ones. For example, consider the following
configuration file excerpt:

<blockquote>
<pre>
attributes(*,CKO_PRIVATE_KEY,*) = {
  CKA_SIGN = true
}

attributes(*,CKO_PRIVATE_KEY,CKK_DH) = {
  CKA_SIGN = null
}

attributes(*,CKO_PRIVATE_KEY,CKK_RSA) = {
  CKA_DECRYPT = true
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first entry says to specify <tt>CKA_SIGN = true</tt> for all private keys.
The second option overrides that with <tt>null</tt> for Diffie-Hellman private keys,
so the <tt>CKA_SIGN</tt> attribute will not specified for them at all. Finally,
the third option says to also specify <tt>CKA_DECRYPT = true</tt> for RSA private
keys. That means RSA private keys will have both <tt>CKA_SIGN = true</tt> and
<tt>CKA_DECRYPT = true</tt> set.

<p>
There is also a special form of the <tt>attributes</tt> option. You can write
<tt>attributes = compatibility</tt> in the configuration file.
That is a shortcut for a whole set of
attribute statements. They are designed to provider maximum compatibility with
existing Java applications, which may expect, for example, all key components to be accessible
and secret keys to be useable for both encryption and decryption. The <tt>compatibility</tt>
attributes line can be used together with other <tt>attributes</tt> lines, in which
case the same aggregation and overriding rules apply as described earlier.

<H3>2.3 Accessing Network Security Services (NSS)</H3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/">Network Security 
Services (NSS)</a> is a set of open source security libraries
used by the Mozilla/Firefox browsers, Sun's Java Enterprise System server
software, and a number of other products. Its crypto APIs are based on PKCS#11
but it includes special features that are outside of the PKCS#11 standard.
The Sun PKCS#11 provider includes code to interact with these NSS specific
features, including
several NSS specific configuration directives, which are described below.

<p>
For best results, we recommend that you use the latest version of NSS available.
It should be at least version 3.11.1.

<p>The Sun PKCS#11 provider uses NSS specific code when any of the
<code>nss</code> configuration directives described below are used. In that
case, the regular configuration commands <code>library</code>,
<code>slot</code>, and <code>slotListIndex</code> cannot be used.

<p>
<table border>
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td>nssLibraryDirectory</td>
<td>directory containing the NSS and NSPR libraries
</td>
<td>
This is the full pathname of the directory containing the NSS
and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/">NSPR</a> libraries.
It must be specified unless NSS has already been loaded and initialized
by another component running in the same process as the Java VM.
<p>
Depending on your platform, you may have to set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
or <code>PATH</code> (on Windows) to include this directory in order to allow
the operating system to locate the dependent libraries.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>nssSecmodDirectory</td>
<td>directory containing the NSS DB files
</td>
<td>
The full pathname of the directory containing the NSS configuration and
key information (<code>secmod.db</code>, <code>key3.db</code>, and
<code>cert8.db</code>). This directive must be specified unless NSS
has already been initialized by another component (see above) or NSS
is used without database files as described below.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nssDbMode</td>
<td>one of <code>readWrite</code>, <code>readOnly</code>, and <code>noDb</code>
</td>
<td>
This directives determines how the NSS database is accessed. In read-write
mode, full access is possible but only one process at a time should be
accessing the databases. Read-only mode disallows modifications to the files.

<p>The noDb mode allows NSS to be used without database files purely as a
cryptographic provider. It is not possible to create persistent keys using
the PKCS11 KeyStore. This mode is useful because NSS includes highly optimized
implementations and algorithms not currently available in 
Sun's bundled Java based crypto providers,
for example Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nssModule</td>
<td>one of <code>keystore</code>, <code>crypto</code>, <code>fips</code>, and
<code>trustanchors</code>
</td>
<td>
NSS makes its functionality available using several different libraries
and slots. This
directive determines which of these modules is accessed by this instance
of SunPKCS11.

<p>
The <code>crypto</code> module is the default in <code>noDb</code> mode.
It supports crypto operations without login but no persistent keys.

<p>
The <code>fips</code> module is the default if the NSS <code>secmod.db</code>
has been set to FIPS-140 compliant mode. In this mode, NSS restricts the
available algorithms and the PKCS#11 attributes with which keys can be
created.

<p>
The <code>keystore</code> module is the default in other configurations.
It supports persistent keys using the PKCS11 KeyStore, which are stored
in the NSS DB files. This module requires login.

<p>
The <code>trustanchors</code> module enables access to NSS trust anchor
certificates via the PKCS11 KeyStore, if <code>secmod.db</code> has been
configured to include the trust anchor library.

<H2>3.0 Application Developers</H2>
<P>Java applications can use the existing JCA and JCE APIs to access PKCS#11 
tokens via the Sun PKCS#11 provider. This is sufficient for many applications 
but it might be difficult for an application to deal with certain PKCS#11 
features, such as unextractable keys and dynamically changing Smartcards. 
Consequently, a number of enhancements were made to the APIs to better support 
applications using certain PKCS#11 features. These enhancments are discussed in 
this section. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><A name=Login></A>
  <H3>3.1 Token Login</H3>
  <P>Certain PKCS#11 operations, such as accessing private keys, require a login 
  using a Personal Identification Number, or PIN, before the operations can 
  proceed. The most common type of operations that require login are those that 
  deal with keys on the token. In a Java application, such operations often 
  involve first loading the keystore. When accessing the PKCS#11 token as a 
  keystore via the <TT>java.security.KeyStore</TT> class, you can supply the PIN 
  in the password input parameter to the <A 
  href="../../../api/java/security/KeyStore.html#load(java.io.InputStream,%20char%5B%5D)">load</A> 
  method, similar to how applications initialize a keystore prior to J2SE 5.0. The
  PIN will then be used by the Sun PKCS#11 provider for logging into the token. 
  Here is an example. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>char[] pin = ...; 
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS11");
ks.load(null, pin); 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This is fine for an application that treats PKCS#11 tokens as static 
  keystores. For an application that wants to accommodate PKCS#11 tokens more 
  dynamically, such as Smartcards being inserted and removed, you can use the 
  new <TT>KeyStore.Builder</TT> class. Here is an example of how to initialize 
  the builder for a PKCS#11 keystore with a callback handler. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>KeyStore.Builder builder = new KeyStore.Builder("PKCS11");
builder.setCallbackHandler(new MyGuiCallbackHandler());
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>For the Sun PKCS#11 provider, the callback handler must be 
  able to satisfy a <TT>PasswordCallback</TT>, which is used to prompt the user 
  for the PIN. Whenever the application needs access to the keystore, it uses 
  the builder as follows. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>KeyStore ks = builder.getKeyStore();
Key key = ks.get(alias, null);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>The builder will prompt for a password as needed using the 
  previously configured callback handler. The builder will prompt for a password 
  only for the initial access. If the user of the application continues using 
  the same Smartcard, the user will not be prompted again. If the user removes 
  and inserts a different SmartCard, the builder will prompt for a password for 
  the new card. <!--To avoid getting the keystore
each time, the application might call <tt>builder.getKeyStore()</tt>
only when its attempt to use the existing keystore throws a
<tt>KeyStoreException</tt>.  To avoid dependencies on the new APIs, an
application can use a similar strategy of catching
<tt>KeyStoreException</tt> and then reloading it via
<tt>KeyStore.load()</tt> instead.
-->
  <P>Depending on the PKCS#11 token, there may be non-key-related operations 
  that also require token login. Applications that use such operations can use 
  the newly introduced <A 
  href="../../../api/java/security/AuthProvider.html"><TT>java.security.AuthProvider</TT></A> 
  class. The <TT>AuthProvider</TT> class extends from 
  <TT>java.security.Provider</TT> and defines methods to perform login and 
  logout operations on a provider, as well as to set a callback handler for the 
  provider to use. <!--By using an <tt>AuthProvider</tt>, an
application can invoke <tt>login</tt> either directly or indirectly.
For the indirect case, <tt>login</tt> is invoked automatically by the
provider when it needs to perform an operation that requires
authentication (and authentication has not occurred earlier).
-->For 
  the Sun PKCS#11 provider, the callback handler must be able to satisfy a 
  <TT>PasswordCallback</TT>, which is used to prompt the user for the PIN. 
  <P>Here is an example of how an application might use an <TT>AuthProvider</TT> 
  to log into the token. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>AuthProvider aprov = Security.getProvider("SunPKCS11");
aprov.login(subject, new MyGuiCallbackHandler());
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><!--When <tt>aprov</tt> is used later for an operation that implicitly
requires authentication, the provider will use the previously
installed callback handler. If no callback handler has be set
explicitly, then the callback handler set by the

  <H3>3.3 Delayed Provider Selection</H3>
  <P>Prior to J2SE 5.0, the Java cryptography <TT>getInstance()</TT>
  methods, such as <TT>Cipher.getInstance("DES")</TT>, returned the 
  implementation from the first provider that implemented the requested 
  algorithm. This is problematic if an application attempts to use a 
  <TT>Key</TT> object for an unextractable token key with a provider that only 
  accepts software key objects. In such a case, the provider would throw an 
  <TT>InvalidKeyException</TT>. This is an issue for the <TT>Cipher</TT>, 
  <TT>KeyAgreement</TT>, <TT>Mac</TT>, and <TT>Signature</TT> classes. </P>
  <P>J2SE 5.0, addresses this issue <A name=Init></A>by delaying the
  selection of the provider until the relevant initialization method is called. 
  The initialization method accepts a <TT>Key</TT> object and can determine at 
  that point which provider can accept the specified <TT>Key</TT> object. This 
  ensures that the selected provider can use the specified <TT>Key</TT> object. 
  The following represents the affected initialization methods. </P><TT>
  <UL>
    <LI><A 
    href="../../../api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html">Cipher</A>.init(..., 
    Key key, ...) 
    <LI><A

    key, ...) 
    <LI><A

    key, ...) 
    <LI><A 
    href="../../../api/java/security/Signature.html">Signature</A>.initSign(PrivateKey 
    privateKey) </LI></UL></TT>Furthermore, if an application calls the 
  initialization method multiple times (each time with a different key, for 
  example), the proper provider for the given key is selected each time. In 
  other words, a different provider may be selected for each initialization 
  call.
  <P>Although this delayed provider selection is hidden from the application, it 
  does affect the behavior of the <CODE>getProvider()</CODE> method for 
  <TT>Cipher</TT>, <TT>KeyAgreement</TT>, <TT>Mac</TT>, and <TT>Signature</TT>. 
  If <CODE>getProvider()</CODE> is called <I>before</I> the initialization 
  operation has occurred (and therefore before provider selection has occurred), 
  then the first provider that supports the requested algorithm is returned. 
  This may not be the same provider as the one selected <EM>after</EM> the 
  initialization method is called. If <CODE>getProvider()</CODE> is called 
  <I>after</I> the initialization operation has occurred, then the actual 
  selected provider is returned. It is recommended that applications only call 
  <CODE>getProvider()</CODE> after they have called the relevant initialization 
  method. </P>
  <P>In addition to <CODE>getProvider()</CODE>, the following additional methods 
  are similarly affected.<TT>

<H2>5.0 Provider Developers</H2>
<P>J2SE 5.0 introduces new facilities in the <A
href="../../../api/java/security/Provider.html">java.security.Provider</A> 
class for provider implementations to more easily support PKCS#11 tokens and 
cryptographic services in general. These new facilities are discussed below. 
<P>See <A 
href="#ExampleProvider">Appendix 
C</A> for an example of a simple provider designed to demonstrate the new 
facilties. 
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><A name=Service></A>
  <H3>5.1 Provider Services</H3>
  <P>As described in the above provider documentation, prior to J2SE 5.0, providers were required to create <TT>java.util.Property</TT> entries
  describing the services they supported. For each service implemented by the 
  provider, there must be a property whose name is the type of service 
  (<TT>Cipher</TT>, <TT>Signature</TT>, etc), followed by a period and the name 
  of the algorithm to which the service applies. The property value must specify 
  the fully qualified name of the class implementing the service. Here is an 
  example of a provider setting <TT>KeyAgreement.DiffieHellman</TT> property to 
  have the value <TT>com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyAgreement</TT>. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>put("KeyAgreement.DiffieHellman", 
      "com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyAgreement")
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>J2SE 5.0 introduces a new public static nested class, <TT><A
  href="../../../api/java/security/Provider.Service.html">Provider.Service</A></TT>, 
  to help better encapsulate the properties of a provider service (including its 
  type, attributes, algorithm name, and algorithm aliases). Providers can 
  instantiate <TT>Provider.Service</TT> objects and register them by calling the 
  <TT>Provider.putService()</TT> method. This is equivalent to creating a 
  <TT>Property</TT> entry and calling the <TT>Provider.put()</TT> method (as was 
  done prior to J2SE 5.0). Note that legacy <TT>Property</TT> entries
  registered via <TT>Provider.put</TT> are still supported. 
  <P>Here is an example of a provider creating a <TT>Service</TT> object with 
  the <TT>KeyAgreement</TT> type, for the <TT>DiffieHellman</TT> algorithm, 
  implemented by the class <TT>com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyAgreement</TT>. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Service s = new Service(this, "KeyAgreement", "DiffieHellman",
    "com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyAgreement", null, null);
putService(s);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Using <TT>Provider.Servicee</TT> objects instead of legacy 
  <TT>Property</TT> entries has a couple of major benefits. One benefit is that 
  it allows the provider to have greater flexibility when <A 
  href="#NewInstance">instantiating 
  engine classes</A>. Another benefit is that it allows the provider to test <A 
  href="#SupportsParam">parameter 
  validity</A>. These features are discussed in detail next. </P>

  <A name=NewInstance></A>
    <H3>5.1.1 Instantiating Engine Classes</H3>
    <P>Prior to J2SE 5.0, the Java Cryptography framework looked up the
    provider property for a particular service and directly instantiated the 
    engine class registered for that property. J2SE 5.0, has the same
    behavior by default, but allows the provider to override this behavior and 
    instantiate the engine class for the requested service itself. </P>
    <P>To override the default behavior, the provider overrides the 
    <TT>Provider.Service.newInstance()</TT> method to add its customer behavior. 
    For example, the provider might call a custom constructor, or might perform 
    initialization using information not accessible outside the provider (or 
    that are only known by the provider). <!--<strong>??? How does PKCS11 provider make use of this flexibility</strong>--><A 
    name=SupportsParam></A></P>
    <H3>5.1.2 Parameter Support</H3>
    <P>The Java Cryptography framework may attempt a fast check to determine 
    whether a provider's service implementation can use an application-specified 
    parameter. To perform this fast check, the framework calls 
    <TT>Provider.Service.supportsParameter()</TT>. </P>
    <P>In J2SE 5.0, the framework relies on this fast test during <A
    href="#DelayedSelect">delayed 
    provider selection</A>. When an application invokes an <A 
    href="#Init">initialization</A> 
    method and passes it a <TT>Key</TT> object, the framework asks an underlying 
    provider whether it supports the object by calling its 
    <TT>Service.supportsParameter()</TT> method. If 
    <CODE>supportsParameter()</CODE> returns <CODE>false</CODE>, the framework 
    can immediately remove that provider from consideration. If 
    <CODE>supportsParameter()</CODE> returns <CODE>true</CODE>, the framework 
    passes the <TT>Key</TT> object to that provider's initialization engine 
    class implementation. A provider that requires software <TT>Key</TT> objects 
    should override this method to return <CODE>false</CODE> when it is passed 
    non-software keys. Likewise, a provider for a PKCS#11 token that contains 
    unextractable keys should only return <CODE>true</CODE> for <TT>Key</TT> 
    objects that it created, and which therefore correspond to the <TT>Key</TT>s 
    on its respective token. </P>
    <P>Note that the default implementation of <CODE>supportsParameter()</CODE> 
    returns <CODE>true</CODE>. This allows existing providers to work without 
    modification. However, because of this lenient default implementation, the 
    framework must be prepared to catch exceptions thrown by providers that 
    reject the <TT>Key</TT> object inside their initialization engine class 
    implementations. The framework treats these cases the same as when 
    <CODE>supportsParameter()</CODE> returns <CODE>false</CODE>.

corresponding PKCS#11 mechanisms needed to support them. When multiple 
mechanisms are listed, they are given in the order of preference and any one of 
them is sufficent. 
Note that SunPKCS11 can be instructed to ignore mechanisms by using the

<P>For Elliptic Curve mechanisms, SunPKCS11 will only use keys that use the

<H2>Appendix B: Sun PKCS#11 provider's KeyStore Requirements</H2>

<p> The following describes the requirements placed by the
Sun PKCS#11 Provider's KeyStore implementation on the
underlying native PKCS#11 library.
<b>
Note that changes may be made in future releases to maximize
interoperability with as many existing PKCS#11 libraries as possible.
</b>

<blockquote>
<h3>Read-Only Access</h3>

<p> To map existing objects stored on a PKCS#11 token to KeyStore entries,
the Sun PKCS#11 Provider's KeyStore implementation performs the
following operations.

<ol>
<li> A search for all private key objects on the token
     is performed by calling C_FindObjects[Init|Final].
     The search template includes the following attributes:

     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> CKA_TOKEN = true
     <li> CKA_CLASS = CKO_PRIVATE_KEY
     </ul>
     <p>
     
<li> A search for all certificate objects on the token
     is performed by calling C_FindObjects[Init|Final].
     The search template includes the following attributes:

     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> CKA_TOKEN = true
     <li> CKA_CLASS = CKO_CERTIFICATE
     </ul>
     <p>
     
<li> Each private key object is matched with its corresponding
     certificate by retrieving their respective CKA_ID attributes.
     A matching pair must share the same unique CKA_ID.

     <p> For each matching pair, the certificate chain is built
     by following the issuer->subject path.  From the end entity certificate,
     a call fo C_FindObjects[Init|Final] is made with a search template
     that includes the following attributes:

     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> CKA_TOKEN = true
     <li> CKA_CLASS = CKO_CERTIFICATE
     <li> CKA_SUBJECT = [DN of certificate issuer]
     </ul>
     <p>

     <p> This search is continued until either no certificate for the
     issuer is found, or until a self-signed certificate is found.
     If more than one certificate is found the first one is used.

     <p> Once a private key and certificate have been matched
     (and its certificate chain built), the information is stored
     in a private key entry with the CKA_LABEL value from
     end entity certificate as the KeyStore alias.

     <p> If the end entity certificate has no CKA_LABEL,
     then the alias is derived from the CKA_ID.  
     If the CKA_ID can be determined to consist exclusively of
     printable characters, then a String alias is created by decoding the
     CKA_ID bytes using the UTF-8 charset.  Otherwise, a hex String alias is
     created from the CKA_ID bytes ("0xFFFF...", for example).

     <p> If multiple certificates share the same CKA_LABEL,
     then the alias is derived from the CKA_LABEL plus the
     end entity certificate issuer and serial number
     ("MyCert/CN=foobar/1234", for example).

<li> Each certificate not part of a private key entry
     (as the end entity certificate) is checked whether it is trusted.
     If the CKA_TRUSTED attribute is true, then a KeyStore
     trusted certificate entry is created with the CKA_LABEL
     value as the KeyStore alias.  If the certificate has no CKA_LABEL,
     or if multiple certificates share the same CKA_LABEL,
     then the alias is derived as described above.

     <p> If the CKA_TRUSTED attribute is not supported
     then no trusted certificate entries are created.

<li> Any private key or certificate object not part of a private key entry
     or trusted certificate entry is ignored.
     <p>
     
<li> A search for all secret key objects on the token
     is performed by calling C_FindObjects[Init|Final].
     The search template includes the following attributes:

     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> CKA_TOKEN = true
     <li> CKA_CLASS = CKO_SECRET_KEY
     </ul>
     <p>

     <p> A KeyStore secret key entry is created for each
     secret key object, with the CKA_LABEL value as the KeyStore alias.
     Each secret key object must have a unique CKA_LABEL.
</ol>

<h3>Write Access</h3>

<p> To create new KeyStore entries on a PKCS#11 token to KeyStore entries,
the Sun PKCS#11 Provider's KeyStore implementation performs the
following operations.

<ol>
<li> When creating a KeyStore entry (during KeyStore.setEntry, for example),
     C_CreateObject is called with CKA_TOKEN=true to create token objects
     for the respective entry contents.

     <p> Private key objects are stored with CKA_PRIVATE=true.
     The KeyStore alias (UTF8-encoded) is set as the CKA_ID for
     both the private key and the corresponding end entity certificate.
     The KeyStore alias is also set as the CKA_LABEL for the
     end entity certificate object.

     <p> Each certificate in a private key entry's chain is also stored.
     The CKA_LABEL is not set for CA certificates.
     If a CA certificate is already in the token,
     a duplicate is not stored.

     <p> Secret key objects are stored with CKA_PRIVATE=true.
     The KeyStore alias is set as the CKA_LABEL.

<li> If an attempt is made to convert a session object to a token object
     (for example, if KeyStore.setEntry is called and the private key object
     in the specified entry is a session ojbect), then C_CopyObject
     is called with CKA_TOKEN=true.
     <p>

<li> If multiple certificates in the token are found to share the same
     CKA_LABEL, then the write capabilities to the token are disabled.
     <p>

<li> Since the PKCS#11 specification does not allow regular applications
     to set CKA_TRUSTED=true (only token initialization applications may do so),
     trusted certificate entries can not be created.
</ol>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p> In addition to the searches listed above, the following searches
may be used by the Sun PKCS#11 provider's KeyStore implementation to perform
internal functions.  Specifically, C_FindObjects[Init|Final] may be called with
any of the following attribute templates:

<ul>
<li><pre>
    CKA_TOKEN    true
    CKA_CLASS    CKO_CERTIFICATE
    CKA_SUBJECT  [subject DN]
    </pre>
<li><pre>
    CKA_TOKEN    true
    CKA_CLASS    CKO_SECRET_KEY
    CKA_LABEL    [label]
    </pre>
<li><pre>
    CKA_TOKEN    true
    CKA_CLASS    CKO_CERTIFICATE or CKO_PRIVATE_KEY
    CKA_ID       [cka_id] 
    </pre>
</ul>
