Iterating over a collection is uglier than it needs to be.  Consider the
following method, which takes a collection of timer tasks and cancels them:
<blockquote>
<pre>void cancelAll(Collection&lt;TimerTask&gt; c) {
    for (<font color="#cc0000">Iterator&lt;TimerTask&gt; i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); </font>)
        <font color="#cc0000">i.next()</font>.cancel();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The iterator is just clutter. Furthermore, it is an opportunity for
error.  The iterator variable occurs three times in each loop: that is
two chances to get it wrong. The for-each construct gets rid of the
clutter and the opportunity for error. Here is how the example looks
with the for-each construct:

<blockquote>
<pre>void cancelAll(Collection&lt;TimerTask&gt; c) {
    for (<font color="#009900">TimerTask t : c</font>)
        t.cancel();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When you see the colon (<code>:</code>) read it as &#8220;in.&#8221;
The loop above reads as &#8220;for each <code>TimerTask t</code> in <code>c</code>.&#8221; As
you can see, the for-each construct combines beautifully with
<a href="generics.html">generics</a>. It preserves all of the type safety,
while removing the remaining clutter. Because you don't have to declare the
iterator, you don't have to provide a generic declaration for it. (The
compiler does this for you behind your back, but you need not concern yourself
with it.)

<p>
Here is a common mistake people make when they are trying to do nested
iteration over two collections:

<blockquote>
<pre>List suits = ...;
List ranks = ...;
List sortedDeck = new ArrayList();

<b><font color="#cc0000">// BROKEN - throws NoSuchElementException!</font></b>
for (Iterator i = suits.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
    for (Iterator j = ranks.iterator(); j.hasNext(); )
        sortedDeck.add(new Card(i.next(), j.next()));
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you spot the bug? Don't feel bad if you can't. Many expert programmers
have made this mistake at one time or another.  The problem is that the
<code>next</code> method is being called too many times on the &#8220;outer&#8221;
collection (<code>suits</code>).  It is being called in the inner loop for both
the outer and inner collections, which is wrong. In order to fix it, you have
to add a variable in the scope of the outer loop to hold the suit:

<blockquote>
<pre><b>// Fixed, though a bit ugly</b>
for (Iterator i = suits.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    <font color="#009900">Suit suit = (Suit) i.next();</font>
    for (Iterator j = ranks.iterator(); j.hasNext(); )
        sortedDeck.add(new Card(suit, j.next()));
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does all this have to do with the for-each construct?  It is
tailor-made for nested iteration!  Feast your eyes:
<blockquote>
<pre>for (Suit suit : suits)
    for (Rank rank : ranks)
        sortedDeck.add(new Card(suit, rank));
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The for-each construct is also applicable to arrays, where it hides
the index variable rather than the iterator. The following method
returns the sum of the values in an <code>int</code> array:

<blockquote>
<pre><b>// Returns the sum of the elements of a</b>
int sum(<font color="#009900">int[] a</font>) {
    int result = 0;
    for (<font color="#009900">int i : a</font>)
        result += i;
    return result;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So when should you use the for-each loop? Any time you can. It really
beautifies your code.  Unfortunately, you cannot use it everywhere.  Consider,
for example, the <a href="generics.html#expurgate"><code>expurgate</code></a>
method. The program needs access to the iterator in order to remove the
current element.  The for-each loop hides the iterator, so you cannot
call <code>remove</code>.  Therefore, the for-each loop is not usable for
filtering.  Similarly it is not usable for loops where you need to
replace elements in a list or array as you traverse it.  Finally, it is
not usable for loops that must iterate over multiple collections in
parallel.  These shortcomings were known by the designers, who made a
conscious decision to go with a clean, simple construct that would
cover the great majority of cases.
